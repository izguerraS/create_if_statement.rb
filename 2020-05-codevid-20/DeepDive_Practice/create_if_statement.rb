# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

# locker = 5
# if locker == 10
#     p 0
# else
#     p -1
# end


# 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

# box = 10
# if box < 10
#     p -1
# elsif box > 10
#     p 0
# elsif box == 10
#     p 0
# end

# 3. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.

# a = 5
# b = 2
# if a + b < 10
#     p 1
# else
#     p 0
# end

# 4. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1 if the number is over 9000, and prints -1 otherwise.

# i = 9001
# if i > 9000
#     p 1
# else
#     p 0
# end

# 5. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 9 if the number is less than 10, prints 19 if the number is less than 20, prints 29 if the number is less than 30, and prints -1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

# a = 50
# if a < 10 
#     p 9
# elsif a < 20
#     p 19
# elsif a < 30
#     p 29
# else
#     p -1
# end

# 6. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 100 if either number is greater than 10, and prints -100 otherwise.
